# Netlify to serve up Github pages

- Github is **NOT** slow for making changes

- **Solution**: **Have Netlify.com serve up you repository**
- Sign up to https://netlify.com with your Github credentials (username  / password)
- Example
- https://1000-darth-vader.netlify.com/  (you can change the subdomain to anything you want)
